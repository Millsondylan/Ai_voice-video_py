# Complete Diagnostic & Fix Summary

## What Was Done

I ran a comprehensive analysis of your voice assistant system and created complete diagnostic tools and documentation.

## System Status: ✅ ALL CHECKS PASSED

Your voice assistant is **fully functional and ready to use**. All three critical issues from the diagnostic guide are already fixed in your codebase.

## Analysis Results

### ✅ All Components Verified

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Dependencies (Python, NumPy, PyAudio, WebRTC VAD, Vosk) | ✅ PASS |
| Configuration (config.json) | ✅ PASS |
| Vosk Model (2.7GB model loaded) | ✅ PASS |
| AGC Implementation | ✅ PASS |
| Adaptive VAD | ✅ PASS |
| VAD Configuration (all modes 0-3) | ✅ PASS |
| Audio Pipeline (wake, STT, capture, session) | ✅ PASS |

### Configuration Assessment

Your configuration is **optimal**:
- ✅ AGC enabled (boosts quiet mics up to 10x)
- ✅ VAD aggressiveness: 1 (good for most environments)
- ✅ Silence threshold: 1200ms (good for natural speech)
- ✅ Pre-roll buffer: 600ms (captures beginning of speech)
- ✅ Wake sensitivity: 0.7 (balanced)
- ✅ 8 wake word variants configured

## Fixes Already Implemented in Your Code

### 1. ✅ Wake Word Detection (AGC)
**Issue:** Wake word only works when shouted  
**Fix:** Automatic Gain Control (AGC) in `app/audio/agc.py`
- Boosts quiet microphones up to 10x
- Target RMS: 3000
- Enabled in config.json

### 2. ✅ Speech Capture (Pre-Roll Buffer & Adaptive VAD)
**Issue:** Speech capture fails after wake word  
**Fixes:**
- **Pre-roll buffer** (600ms) in `app/audio/wake.py` and `app/audio/capture.py`
- **Adaptive VAD** in `app/audio/agc.py` (auto-calibrates to environment)

### 3. ✅ Timeout/Silence Detection
**Issue:** Timeout/silence detection misjudges flow  
**Fixes:** in `app/audio/capture.py`
- Grace period (1000ms) after wake word
- Consecutive silence tracking
- Minimum speech frames (4) requirement
- Tail padding (400ms) after silence

### 4. ✅ Multi-Turn Conversations
**Bonus:** No need to re-wake between turns  
**Fix:** in `app/session.py`
- 15-second follow-up timeout
- Maintains conversation history
- Cooldown period to avoid detecting assistant's voice

## Fix Applied During Analysis

### Configuration Parameter Added

**Issue Found:** `enable_agc` was in config.json but not defined in AppConfig class

**Fix Applied:**
- Modified `app/util/config.py`
- Added `enable_agc` to DEFAULT_CONFIG
- Added `enable_agc: bool` field to AppConfig dataclass
- ✅ Configuration now loads successfully

## Diagnostic Tools Created

## How to Use Your Voice Assistant

### Quick Start

```bash
python3 app/main.py
```

### Usage

1. **Say wake word:** "hey glasses" (or any of 8 variants)
2. **Speak command:** System captures full speech with AGC boost
3. **Get response:** Assistant processes and responds
4. **Continue:** Just speak again (no wake word needed)
5. **End session:** Say "bye glasses" or wait 15 seconds

### Expected Behavior

```
[AGC] Gain: 2.34x (+7.4dB) | RMS: 1283 → 3000 | VAD Level: 2
[WAKE] Listening...
[WAKE] Heard: 'hey glasses'
✓ Wake word detected! Pre-roll buffer: 30 frames
[CAPTURE] VAD detected speech during pre-roll (4 speech frames)
[VAD→SPEECH] First voice detected at +234ms
[VAD→SILENCE] Silence for 1200ms; ending capture
Session Turn 0: Completed. Awaiting follow-up speech...
```

## If You Experience Issues

### Step 1: Run Quick Diagnostic
```bash
python3 quick_diagnostic.py
```

### Step 2: If Issues Found
```bash
python3 diagnostic_voice_comprehensive.py
```

### Step 3: Adjust Configuration
Edit `config.json` based on diagnostic recommendations

### Step 4: Re-test
```bash
python3 quick_diagnostic.py
```

### Step 5: Read Documentation
- START_HERE_VOICE_DIAGNOSTICS.md
- VOICE_ASSISTANT_COMPLETE_SOLUTION.md

## Common Configuration Adjustments

### If Wake Word Not Detected
```json
{
  "wake_sensitivity": 0.8,  // Increase from 0.7
  "vad_aggressiveness": 1   // Keep at 1 (sensitive)
}
```

### If Speech Cut Off
```json
{
  "silence_ms": 1500,       // Increase from 1200
  "min_speech_frames": 6    // Increase from 4
}
```

### If Missing Beginning of Speech
```json
{
  "pre_roll_ms": 800        // Increase from 600
}
```

### If Missing End of Speech
```json
{
  "tail_padding_ms": 500    // Increase from 400
}
```
