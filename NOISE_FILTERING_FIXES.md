# 🔇 Noise Filtering & Wake Word Fixes Applied

## Issues Observed from Test Run

From your logs:
```
[WAKE] Heard: 'it has since'
[WAKE] Heard: 'it has buttons hey'
[WAKE] Heard: 'the the the'
[WAKE] Heard: 'the the the eyeglasses'
```

**Problems**:
1. ❌ Vosk hallucinating "the the the" from background noise
2. ❌ Wake word "hey glasses" not triggering even when Vosk heard "eyeglasses"
3. ❌ Background noise being transcribed as random words

## Root Cause Analysis

### Problem 1: AdaptiveVAD Thresholds Wrong for AGC-Boosted Audio

**Issue**: AdaptiveVAD was calibrating on AGC-boosted audio, giving incorrect VAD level selection

**Flow**:
```
1. Raw background noise: RMS 100 (very quiet)
2. AGC boosts it 60x: RMS 6000
3. AdaptiveVAD calibrates on 6000 RMS
4. AdaptiveVAD thinks: "Background is LOUD (> 500 RMS)"
5. AdaptiveVAD selects: VAD Level 3 (least sensitive)
6. Result: Real speech also at 6000 RMS is barely detected
```

**Evidence from logs**:
```
[AGC] Auto-selected VAD level 3 (background RMS: 2213.5)
[AGC] Auto-selected VAD level 2 (background RMS: 337.4)
```

Background RMS of 2213 is AGC-boosted silence, not actual loud background!

### Problem 2: No RMS Gate Before Feeding STT

**Issue**: Even if VAD said "speech", low-RMS boosted noise was fed to Vosk

**Flow**:
```
1. Very quiet background: RMS 30 raw
2. AGC boosts 200x: RMS 6000
3. VAD sees 6000 RMS: "This is speech!"
4. Feed to Vosk: Boosted silence
5. Vosk hallucinates: "the the the"
```

### Problem 3: Wake Word Matching Too Strict

**Issue**: "the the the eyeglasses" didn't match "hey glasses"

**Why**:
- Token matching: `['the', 'eyeglasses']` vs `['hey', 'glasses']`
- "the" vs "hey": similarity 0.3 < 0.72 threshold → NO MATCH
- Never got to check "eyeglasses" vs "glasses"

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Updated AdaptiveVAD Thresholds for AGC-Boosted Audio

**File**: [app/audio/agc.py:154-177](app/audio/agc.py#L154-177)

**Before** (thresholds for raw audio):
```python
if self.background_rms < 100:     # Raw quiet
    self.vad_level = 1
elif self.background_rms < 500:  # Raw moderate
    self.vad_level = 2
else:                             # Raw loud
    self.vad_level = 3
```

**After** (thresholds for AGC-boosted audio, target_rms=6000):
```python
if self.background_rms < 3000:    # Boosted quiet (raw was very quiet)
    self.vad_level = 1
elif self.background_rms < 5000:  # Boosted moderate (raw was moderate)
    self.vad_level = 2
else:                              # Boosted loud (raw was loud)
    self.vad_level = 3
```

**Why it works**:
- Background RMS 2213 → VAD Level 1 (most sensitive) ✅
- Background RMS 337 → VAD Level 1 (most sensitive) ✅
- Real speech at 6000 RMS easily detected

---

### Fix 2: Added RMS Gate Before Feeding STT

**File**: [app/audio/wake.py:174-190](app/audio/wake.py#L174-190)

**Added double-check**:
```python
# 1. VAD must detect speech
speech_detected = self._adaptive_vad.is_speech(gained_frame)

# 2. RMS must be above minimum threshold
if speech_detected:
    frame_rms = calculate_rms(gained_frame)
    min_speech_rms = 1800  # 30% of target (6000)

    # Only feed to STT if BOTH VAD and RMS confirm real speech
    if frame_rms >= min_speech_rms:
        self._transcriber.feed(gained_frame)
```

**Why it works**:
- AGC-boosted silence (RMS 6000 but was very quiet): RMS check fails → not fed to STT ✅
- Real speech (RMS 6000): Both VAD and RMS pass → fed to STT ✅
- Prevents Vosk from seeing boosted silence

**Threshold Logic**:
- Target RMS: 6000 (after AGC)
- Real speech should reach ~6000 RMS
- Minimum for STT: 1800 RMS (30% of target)
- Anything below 1800 is likely boosted noise, not speech

### Fix 3: Improved Wake Word Matching

#### A. Added More Wake Variants

**File**: [config.json:24-38](config.json#L24-38)

**Added variants**:
```json
"wake_variants": [
  "hey glasses",
  "hi glasses",
  "ok glasses",
  "eyeglasses",      // NEW - single word variant
  "the glasses",     // NEW - common with "the" hallucination
  "hey gases",       // NEW - common Vosk misrecognition
  "it glasses",      // NEW - from "it has" misrecognition
  "glasses"          // NEW - fallback single word
]
```

#### B. Lowered Fuzzy Match Threshold

**File**: [app/audio/wake.py:266-269](app/audio/wake.py#L266-269)

**Before**:
```python
if SequenceMatcher(None, cand_clean, target_clean).ratio() >= 0.72:
    continue
```

**After**:
```python
# FIX: Lowered from 0.72 to 0.65 for more lenient matching
if SequenceMatcher(None, cand_clean, target_clean).ratio() >= 0.65:
    continue
```

**Impact**:
- "hey" vs "the": ratio ~0.3 → Still no match
- "hey" vs "hay": ratio ~0.67 → NOW matches! (was 0.67 < 0.72 before)
- "glasses" vs "eyeglasses": Exact substring match → matches
- "gases" vs "glasses": ratio ~0.71 → NOW matches!

## Expected Results

### Before These Fixes:
```
❌ AdaptiveVAD: Background 2213 RMS → VAD 3 (too strict)
❌ No RMS gate: Boosted silence fed to Vosk → "the the the"
❌ Wake variants: Missing "eyeglasses", "the glasses"
❌ Fuzzy threshold: 0.72 too strict, missed "gases"
❌ Result: Wake word didn't trigger, noise transcribed
```

### After These Fixes:
```
✅ AdaptiveVAD: Background 2213 RMS → VAD 1 (appropriate)
✅ RMS gate: Only feed frames > 1800 RMS to STT (real speech)
✅ Wake variants: Added 5 new common misrecognitions
✅ Fuzzy threshold: 0.65 catches more variations
✅ Result: Wake word triggers reliably, no noise transcription
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Restart the App

```bash
python3 app/main.py
```

### 2. Test Wake Word

**Say at normal volume**:
- "hey glasses" (original)
- "hi glasses" (variant)
- Just "glasses" (single word fallback)

**Expected**: Should trigger on all three

**Check logs for**:
```
[AGC] Auto-selected VAD level 1 (background RMS: 2213.5)
✓ Wake word detected! Transcript: 'hey glasses'
```

### 3. Test Noise Filtering

**Stay silent** and observe logs.

**Good (should see)**:
```
[AGC] Gain: 20.00x (+26.0dB) | RMS: 143 → 6000 | VAD Level: 1
[WAKE] Listening...
```

**Bad (should NOT see anymore)**:
```
[WAKE] Heard: 'the the the'
[WAKE] Heard: 'it has since'
```

### 4. Test Variable Volume

**Speak very quietly** after wake word.

**Expected logs**:
```
[AGC] Capture complete: Final gain 20.00x (+26.0dB), RMS 62/6000
```

- Gain should be 15x-20x for quiet speech
- Final RMS should be close to 6000
- No "the the the" hallucinations

## Technical Details

### AGC-Boosted Audio Characteristics

With `target_rms=6000` and `max_gain=20x`:

| Scenario | Raw RMS | AGC Gain | Output RMS | VAD Detection |
|----------|---------|----------|------------|---------------|
| Very quiet background | 30 | 200x (capped at 20x) | 600-1200 | VAD says "no speech" |
| Quiet background | 300 | 20x | 6000 | **RMS gate blocks** (< 1800) |
| Normal speech | 1000-2000 | 3x-6x | 6000 | ✅ Passes both VAD & RMS |
| Loud speech | 6000 | 1x | 6000 | ✅ Passes both VAD & RMS |

**Key insight**: RMS gate at 1800 filters boosted silence while allowing real speech.

### AdaptiveVAD Selection Logic

After AGC boost (target=6000):

| Background RMS (after AGC) | Raw Background | VAD Level | Sensitivity |
|----------------------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| < 3000 | Very quiet (raw ~300) | 1 | Most sensitive |
| 3000-5000 | Moderate (raw ~500-800) | 2 | Balanced |
| > 5000 | Loud (raw ~1000+) | 3 | Least sensitive |

**From logs**:
- Background 2213 RMS → VAD 1 ✅ (was VAD 3 before fix)
- Background 337 RMS → VAD 1 ✅

### Wake Word Matching Flow

**Example**: Vosk hears "the the the eyeglasses"

**Tokens**: `['the', 'the', 'the', 'eyeglasses']`

**Matching process**:
1. Try variant "hey glasses" (`['hey', 'glasses']`):
   - Check `['the', 'the']` vs `['hey', 'glasses']` → no match
   - Check `['the', 'the']` vs `['hey', 'glasses']` → no match
   - Check `['the', 'eyeglasses']` vs `['hey', 'glasses']`:
     - "the" vs "hey": ratio 0.3 < 0.65 → no match
   - Check `['the', 'eyeglasses']` vs `['hey', 'glasses']`:
     - "the" vs "hey": ratio 0.3 < 0.65 → no match

2. Try variant "the glasses" (`['the', 'glasses']`):
   - Check `['the', 'the']` vs `['the', 'glasses']` → no match (second word differs)
   - Check `['the', 'eyeglasses']` vs `['the', 'glasses']`:
     - "the" vs "the": exact match ✅
     - "eyeglasses" vs "glasses": "glasses" is substring → **MATCH!** ✅

3. Try variant "eyeglasses" (`['eyeglasses']`):
   - Check `['the']` vs `['eyeglasses']` → no match
   - Check `['the']` vs `['eyeglasses']` → no match
   - Check `['the']` vs `['eyeglasses']` → no match
   - Check `['eyeglasses']` vs `['eyeglasses']` → **MATCH!** ✅

**Result**: Wake word triggers! ✅

## Troubleshooting

### Still Seeing "the the the" in Logs?

**Check RMS gate threshold**:
```bash
tail -f glasses-debug.log | grep RMS
```

**If you see low RMS being fed to STT**:
1. Increase `min_speech_rms` in [app/audio/wake.py:184](app/audio/wake.py#L184)
2. Change from `1800` to `2500` or `3000`

### Wake Word Still Not Triggering?

**Check what Vosk is hearing**:
```bash
tail -f glasses-debug.log | grep WAKE
```

**If Vosk hears something close but doesn't match**:
1. Add that phrase to `wake_variants` in [config.json](config.json#L24-38)
2. Or lower fuzzy threshold further (0.65 → 0.60) in [wake.py:268](app/audio/wake.py#L268)

### AdaptiveVAD Selecting Wrong Level?

**Check calibration logs**:
```bash
tail -f glasses-debug.log | grep "Auto-selected VAD"
```

**If background RMS seems wrong**:
- Background should be measured during silence
- If music/TV is on during startup, it will measure that as "background"
- Restart app in quiet environment for proper calibration

## Summary

### What Was Broken:

1. **AdaptiveVAD** calibrating on boosted audio → selected wrong VAD level
2. **No RMS check** → Vosk hallucinating "the the the" on boosted silence
3. **Missing wake variants** → "eyeglasses" not recognized
4. **Fuzzy threshold too strict** → "hey gases" not matching

### What Got Fixed:

1. ✅ **AdaptiveVAD thresholds** adjusted for AGC-boosted audio (< 3000 → VAD 1)
2. ✅ **RMS gate** added - only feed frames > 1800 RMS to STT
3. ✅ **5 new wake variants** - "eyeglasses", "the glasses", "glasses", etc.
4. ✅ **Fuzzy threshold lowered** to 0.65 (from 0.72)

### Expected Improvements:

✅ **No more "the the the" hallucinations** - RMS gate blocks boosted silence
✅ **Wake word triggers reliably** - More variants, lower threshold
✅ **Better VAD level selection** - Correct thresholds for boosted audio
✅ **Quiet speech works** - 20x AGC boost with proper filtering

---

**Status**: ✅ Ready to test

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-21

Test now and verify:
1. No "the the the" noise transcriptions
2. Wake word triggers on "hey glasses", "glasses", "eyeglasses"
3. Quiet speech is boosted and captured correctly
4. AdaptiveVAD selects appropriate level (likely VAD 1)
