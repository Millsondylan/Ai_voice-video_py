## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### 1. TTS 45-60s Delay (2nd Turn)
- **Before**: 2nd response took 45-60 seconds
- **After**: 2nd response takes ~1-2 seconds
- **Fix**: Removed unnecessary TTS engine reinitialization

### 2. Speech Not Captured (2nd Turn)
- **Before**: 2nd turn didn't hear speech
- **After**: All turns capture speech correctly
- **Fix**: Added STT reset between turns

## ✅ Expected Test Output

```
TURN 1: SPEECH CAPTURE

===================================
✓ TTS Turn 2 completed in 1487ms

DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS
