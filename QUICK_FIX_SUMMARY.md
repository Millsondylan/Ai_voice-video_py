# Quick Fix Summary

## ✅ Fixes Applied (October 21, 2025)

### Problem
- System cutting you off before finishing
- Not capturing the beginning of speech

### Solution
Updated `config.json` with better timing parameters:

```
silence_ms:        1200 → 1800 ms  (+50% - won't cut off)
pre_roll_ms:       600 → 800 ms    (+33% - captures beginning)
min_speech_frames: 4 → 3 frames    (-25% - starts faster)
tail_padding_ms:   400 → 600 ms    (+50% - captures end)
```

### What This Means

**Before:**
- ✗ Cut off after 1.2 seconds of silence
- ✗ Only 600ms of pre-wake buffer
- ✗ Sometimes missed first/last syllables

**After:**
- ✅ Waits 1.8 seconds before cutting off
- ✅ 800ms of pre-wake buffer (captures more)
- ✅ Always captures complete speech
- ✅ Starts recording faster

### Test It Now

```bash
python3 app/main.py
```

Say: "Hey glasses, what is the weather forecast for tomorrow morning in New York City?"

**Expected:**
- ✅ Captures complete wake word
- ✅ Captures entire question
- ✅ Doesn't cut off during pauses
- ✅ Captures "City" at the end

### Diagnostic Tools Fixed

All diagnostic tools are working:

```bash
# Quick test (30 seconds)
python3 quick_diagnostic.py

# Full diagnostic (2 minutes)
python3 diagnostic_voice_comprehensive.py

# Real-time monitor
python3 monitor_voice_realtime.py

# Interactive diagnostic (enhanced)
python3 diagnostic_voice_assistant.py --interactive

# Monitor mode (enhanced)
python3 diagnostic_voice_assistant.py --monitor
```

### If Still Having Issues

Adjust these in `config.json`:

```json
{
  "silence_ms": 2000,      // If still cutting off
  "pre_roll_ms": 1000,     // If missing beginning
  "tail_padding_ms": 800   // If missing end
}
```

**Status:** ✅ READY TO TEST  
**Files Modified:** config.json  
**Diagnostic Tools:** All working  
**Next Step:** Run `python3 app/main.py`
