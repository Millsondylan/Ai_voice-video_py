## What This Fixes

### ✅ Issue 1: Cutting Off Before Finishing

**Problem:** System was cutting you off mid-sentence

**Root Cause:** `silence_ms` was too short (1200ms = 1.2 seconds)

**Fix:** Increased to 1800ms (1.8 seconds)

**Result:**
- Waits 1.8 seconds of silence before ending
- Natural pauses won't trigger cutoff
- Can take breaths or think mid-sentence
- Better for complex questions

### ✅ Issue 2: Not Capturing Beginning

**Problem:** First syllables were being missed

**Root Cause:** `pre_roll_ms` was too short (600ms)

**Fix:** Increased to 800ms

**Result:**
- More audio buffered before wake word
- First syllables always captured
- Wake word itself captured completely
- Smoother transition to recording

## Test Your Fixes

### Test 1: Long Sentence
**Say:** "Hey glasses, what is the weather forecast for tomorrow morning in New York City?"

**Expected:**
- ✅ Captures complete wake word
- ✅ Captures entire question
- ✅ Doesn't cut off even with pauses
- ✅ Captures "City" at the end

### Test 2: With Pause
**Say:** "Hey glasses, what is... the capital of France?"

**Expected:**
- ✅ Doesn't cut off during pause
- ✅ Captures complete question
- ✅ 1.8 second timeout allows thinking
