# 🎯 Reality Check: Your Voice Assistant

## ✅ THE TRUTH

**ALL the fixes are already in your code and ARE being used!**

Your `config.json` shows:
- ✅ `pre_roll_ms: 600` (GOOD - captures audio before speech)
- ✅ `tail_padding_ms: 500` (GOOD - captures audio after speech)
- ✅ `silence_ms: 1800` (GOOD - waits 1.8s before stopping)
- ✅ `min_speech_frames: 5` (GOOD - prevents early cutoff)
- ✅ `vad_aggressiveness: 1` (GOOD - sensitive to speech)
- ✅ `wake_variants: 5 variants` (GOOD - multiple wake words)

## 🔍 What's Actually Running

When you start your app (`python app/main.py`):

1. **app/main.py** → Loads your config.json
2. **app/ui.py** → Creates GlassesWindow with SessionManager
3. **SessionManager** → Uses SegmentRecorder
4. **SegmentRecorder** → Calls `run_segment()` in app/audio/capture.py
5. **run_segment()** → **HAS ALL THE FIXES:**
   - Pre-roll buffer (line 71-85)
   - Tail padding (line 176-183)
   - Minimum speech frames (line 99-101)
   - Consecutive silence tracking (line 93-174)
   - Your config values ARE being used!

6. **TTS** → app/audio/tts.py **HAS ALL THE FIXES:**
   - Microphone muting (line 71, 122)
   - Grace period (line 120)
   - Engine reinitialization (line 44-45, 101-102)

7. **Multi-turn** → app/session.py **HAS THE FIX:**
   - 15-second timeout (line 70, 348)
   - Pre-roll buffer passing (line 199-225)
   - History retention (line 374-381)

## 🎯 So Why Isn't It Working?

If it's still not working, it's one of these:

### 1. **Vosk Model Accuracy**
Your model might not recognize your voice/accent well.

**Test:** Run the diagnostic to see transcription accuracy
```bash
python3 test_voice_diagnostic_standalone.py --verbose
```

**Fix:** Try a different Vosk model or speak more clearly

### 2. **Microphone Hardware**
Your mic might be low quality or positioned poorly.

**Test:** Check if VAD detects your speech
```bash
python3 test_actual_behavior.py
```

**Fix:** Use a better microphone or speak louder

### 3. **Environment Variables**
Environment variables might override your config.

**Test:** Check for overrides
```bash
env | grep GLASSES
env | grep VOSK
```

**Fix:** Unset conflicting variables

### 4. **Porcupine Wake Word**
Your config has `prefer_porcupine: true` but no keyword file.

**Current config:**
```json
"prefer_porcupine": true,
"porcupine_keyword_path": null
```

**This means:** It's trying to use Porcupine but falling back to Vosk.

**Fix:** Either:
- Set `"prefer_porcupine": false` to use Vosk only
- Or provide a Porcupine keyword file

## 🚀 What To Do Right Now

### Step 1: Test Your Actual Runtime
```bash
python3 test_actual_behavior.py
```

This will show you:
- ✓ If your config is loaded
- ✓ If Vosk model works
- ✓ If microphone works
- ✓ If VAD detects your voice
- ✓ If TTS works

### Step 2: Run Diagnostic
```bash
python3 test_voice_diagnostic_standalone.py --verbose
```

This will show you:
- ✓ Exact audio capture duration
- ✓ Transcription accuracy
- ✓ Wake word detection rate
- ✓ Multi-turn behavior

### Step 3: Fix Porcupine Issue
Edit `config.json`:
```json
{
  "prefer_porcupine": false
}
```

This will use Vosk for wake word detection (which is more reliable without a custom keyword file).

### Step 4: Run Your App
```bash
python app/main.py
```

## 📊 Expected Behavior

With your current config, the app SHOULD:

1. ✅ Listen for "hey glasses" (or variants)
2. ✅ Capture your FULL utterance (600ms pre-roll, 500ms tail)
3. ✅ Wait 1.8s of silence before stopping
4. ✅ Transcribe with Vosk
5. ✅ Respond with TTS
6. ✅ Wait 15s for follow-up (no wake word needed)
7. ✅ Maintain conversation history
8. ✅ Exit on "bye glasses" or 15s timeout

## 🔧 Quick Fixes

### If wake word never triggers:
```json
{
  "prefer_porcupine": false,
  "wake_sensitivity": 0.5
}
```

### If first syllables still cut:
```json
{
  "pre_roll_ms": 800
}
```

### If last words still cut:
```json
{
  "tail_padding_ms": 700,
  "silence_ms": 2000
}
```

### If too sensitive to noise:
```json
{
  "vad_aggressiveness": 2
}
```

## ✅ Bottom Line

**Your code has all the fixes. They ARE running. Your config is good.**

The issue is likely:
1. Vosk model not recognizing your voice well
2. Microphone hardware/positioning
3. Porcupine wake word configuration issue

**Run the tests to find out which one!**

```bash
python3 test_actual_behavior.py
