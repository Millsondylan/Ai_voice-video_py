## 💬 How Conversations Work

### First Turn (Need Wake Word)
1. Say: **"Hey Glasses"**
2. Wait for activation
3. Speak your question
4. Get voice reply

### Follow-up Turns (No Wake Word!)
- Just speak after the reply
- System waits 15 seconds for you
- Say "bye glasses" to end anytime

### Session Ends When:
- You say **"bye glasses"**
- **15 seconds** of silence
- You press **Ctrl+G** (manual stop)

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Ctrl+G** | Start session (skip wake word) |
| **Ctrl+G** | Stop current session |
| **Ctrl+Q** | Quit application |

## 🔧 Common Adjustments

### Wake Word Not Triggering Often?

Edit `config.json`:
```json
{
  "porcupine_sensitivity": 0.75
}
```
Higher = more sensitive (0.5-0.9 range)

### Speech Getting Cut Off?

Edit `config.json`:
```json
{
  "silence_ms": 1500
}
```
Higher = waits longer for pauses

### Too Many False Wake Triggers?

Edit `config.json`:
```json
{
  "porcupine_sensitivity": 0.55
}
```
Lower = more strict

## 🎓 Optional: Train Custom Wake Word

For even better accuracy, train "hey glasses" as a custom Porcupine model:

1. Visit: https://console.picovoice.ai
2. Train "hey glasses" wake word
3. Download `.ppn` file to `models/`
4. Update config: `"porcupine_keyword_path": "models/hey-glasses_en_mac.ppn"`

See [PORCUPINE_SETUP_GUIDE.md](PORCUPINE_SETUP_GUIDE.md) for details.
