## 📊 Current Configuration

```json
{
  "vosk_model_path": "models/vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15",
  "camera_source": "0",

  "silence_ms": 1800,           // ← Wait 1.8s before stopping
  "pre_roll_ms": 600,           // ← Capture 600ms before speech
  "min_speech_frames": 5,       // ← Minimum frames before stop
  "tail_padding_ms": 500,       // ← Extra 500ms after speech

  "vad_aggressiveness": 1,      // ← Sensitive (catches all)
  "porcupine_sensitivity": 0.70, // ← More reliable wake word

  "frame_sample_fps": 2,        // ← 2 video frames/second
  "frame_max_images": 6,        // ← Max 6 frames per segment

  "wake_variants": [            // ← 5 wake phrase variants
    "hey glasses",
    "hey-glasses",
    "hay glasses",
    "a glasses",
    "hey glass"
  ]
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Quick Validation Test

```bash
python3 test_complete_capture.py
```

This test:
1. ✅ Checks configuration
2. ✅ Records test phrase
3. ✅ Validates all words captured
4. ✅ Saves audio for verification

### Expected Output

```
✅ Pre-roll buffer: 600ms (good)
✅ Silence threshold: 1800ms (good)
✅ VAD aggressiveness: 1 (sensitive)
✅ Min speech frames: 5 (prevents early cutoff)
✅ Tail padding: 500ms (captures end)

✅ SUCCESS: Complete capture verified!
6/6 key words captured
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Start the Assistant

```bash
./start_assistant.sh
```

### Example Session

```
You: "Hey Glasses"
System: [activates - all ready]

You: "What is the capital of France and how many people live there?"
System: [captures EVERY word including "there" at the end]
System: "The capital of France is Paris, with approximately 2.2 million residents..."

You: "And what about the population of the entire metropolitan area?"
System: [captures follow-up completely]
System: "The Paris metropolitan area has about 12 million residents..."

You: "bye glasses"
System: "Goodbye!"
```

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Long questions fully captured
- ✅ Natural pauses preserved
- ✅ Follow-ups work seamlessly
- ✅ No wake word needed after first turn
- ✅ Video frames captured throughout

## 🎓 Understanding the Settings

### Pre-Roll Buffer (600ms)
```
Timeline:
  [---600ms pre-roll---][WAKE DETECTED][---your speech starts here---]
   ↑ This audio included in capture
```

### Silence Threshold (1800ms)
```
Your Speech:
  "What... [pause 500ms] ...is... [pause 800ms] ...the weather?"
         Still recording ✅     Still recording ✅    Recording stops after 1800ms silence
```

### Tail Padding (500ms)
```
Timeline:
  [...your last word END][---500ms more---][STOP]
                         ↑ Captures trailing sounds
```

### Minimum Speech Frames (5 frames)
```
Frames: [S][S][S][S][S][silence][silence]...
         1  2  3  4  5  ← Need 5 speech frames before allowing silence detection
```
